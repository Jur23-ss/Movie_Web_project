Movie Management System is a web-based application designed for organizing and managing movies, users, and watchlists. Built using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, with MySQL as the database hosted via XAMPP, the system allows administrators to add, edit, and delete movie entries, manage user accounts, and track user watchlists. Users can search for movies, view details such as genre and release date, rate movies, and create personal watchlists. The project features user authentication, a responsive design, and optimized search functionality, making it ideal for film enthusiasts or platforms looking for an efficient movie catalog system
